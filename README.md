# TcpSharp
This clearly states that the TcpSharp fork from [burakoner](https://github.com/burakoner) has been enhanced to support direct IP address usage, without needing to resolve hostnames through DNS.

Original Project: https://github.com/burakoner/TcpSharp
## What's new

- Direct IP address support for client
- After fixing some bugs, both the client and server can now properly respond to each other's disconnection operations.

## How to Use
- This package is available on NuGet as "Xyli.TcpSharp", not the original "TcpSharp".
